# The Ulam Spiral
This is a simple method for the representation of prime numbers that reveals a pattern that was never fully explained.
It was discovered by the mathematician Stanislaw Marcin Ulam, at a scientific conference in 1963.

# Motivation
Fascinated by the simplicity of the idea giving rise to what mysterious reason, I wanted to create by myself and so
improve my knowledge of Python, particularly on the use of the Python Imaging Library library.

# Libraries
- Sympy: Library specialized for mathematical calculations, it is used for its **isprime ()** function that test the primality of a given number as a parameter.
- PIL: Library specializing in image processing in Python, it is used to create the resulting image pixel by pixel
